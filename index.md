### Senior Data Scientist and Strategist in Munich

## About me
As a Senior Data Scientist and Strategist with IDEO's Munich studio, I focus on discovering products that solve human and business problems by working at the intersection of data science, design, and strategy, always through a human-centered approach.

I strongly believe that a deep understanding of the users' needs and business context are key skills for a data scientist. For this reason, in my work, I strive to pair qualitative user research methods along with Machine Learning frameworks, NoSQL databases, and other typical data science tools.

I hold a BSc in Management Engineering (with a major in ICT) from Politecnico di Milano and a MSc in Innovation Management cum laude from the Rotterdam School of Management. 

My experience spans across the automotive, healthcare, financial services, and construction industries.
