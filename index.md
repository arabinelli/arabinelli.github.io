### Senior Data Scientist and Strategist 

## About me
As a Senior Data Scientist and Strategist with IDEO's Munich studio, I focus on discovering products that solve human and business problems by working at the intersection of data science, design, and strategy, always through a human-centered approach.

I strongly believe that a deep understanding of the users' needs and business context are key skills for a data scientist. For this reason, in my work, I strive to pair qualitative user research methods along with Machine Learning frameworks, NoSQL databases, and other typical data science tools.

My experience spans across the automotive, healthcare, financial services, and construction industries.
